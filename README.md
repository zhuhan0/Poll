My first real web app. Currently it's a simple poll about the game Overwatch. The app is deployed on Heroku at [here](https://apoll.herokuapp.com/).

Features to add:

1. Avoid disabling poll input after first input.
2. Make content slide up if user clicks another input.
3. Add social media share feature.

P.S. I'd like to recommend a great Express tutorial on YouTube: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NALxjuyRXaE) [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVrfhONc8Jw).
